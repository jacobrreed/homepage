      with a passion, I love tinkering and building things with code as well as
      hardware. My hobbies include home lab networking and containerization,
      building mechanical keyboards, PC gaming, programming, penetration testing, listening to and playing music (guitar/drums), snowboarding, brewing kombucha,
      baking sourdough, spending time with my wife, our two daughters, and
      my two dogs.

      My skillset is pretty wide but I have a lot of experience in front-end
      development namely: Javascript, Typescript, React, Angular, Docker, and
      Python.
      I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer and to join new development teams. I'm currently looking for a new role as a full-stack developer or backend. Would prefer to work in Golang or Rust.
