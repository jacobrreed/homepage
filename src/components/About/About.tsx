      with a passion, I love tinkering and building things with code as well as
      hardware. My hobbies include home lab networking and containerization,
      building keyboards, PC gaming, programming, penetration testing, listening
      to music, playing music (guitar/drums), snowboarding, brewing kombucha,
      baking sourdough, and spending time with my wife, our two daughters, and
      my two dogs.

      My skillset is pretty wide but I have a lot of experience in front-end
      development namely: Javascript, Typescript, React, Angular, Docker, and
      Python.
